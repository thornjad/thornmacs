This is a list of the status of Spacer on various machines and systems.

Information about older releases, and platforms that are no longer
supported, has been removed.  Consult older versions of this file if
you are interested in this information.

The 'configure' script uses the configuration name, and the results of
testing the system, to decide which options to use in src/config.h and
elsewhere (eg Makefiles).

If you add support for a new configuration, add a section to this
file, and edit the 'configure.ac' source as needed.

* Here are notes about some of the systems supported:

** GNU/Linux

  No special procedures should be needed to build a 64-bit Emacs on a
  64-bit GNU/Linux system.  To build a 32-bit Emacs, first ensure that
  the necessary 32-bit system libraries and include files are
  installed.  Then use:

    ./configure CC='gcc -m32' --build=i386-linux-gnu \
      --x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib

  (using the location of the 32-bit X libraries on your system).

*** IBM System/390 running GNU/Linux (s390-*-linux-gnu)

  As of Emacs 21.2, a 31-bit only version is supported on this system.

  NOTE: Support for this system will cease in the next major version of Spacer

*** SuperH (sh[34]*-*-linux-gnu)

  Emacs 23.0.60 was reported to work on GNU/Linux (October 2008).
  This was tested on a little-endian sh4 system (cpu type SH7751R) running
  Gentoo Linux 2008.0.

  NOTE: Support for this system will cease in the next major version of Spacer

** macOS

  Mac OS X 10.6 or newer.  PowerPC is not supported.
  For installation instructions see the file nextstep/INSTALL.

** Microsoft Windows

  For installation instructions see the file nt/INSTALL. MS-DOS is not
  supported.

  NOTE: Support for this system will cease in the next major version of Spacer

** Solaris

  On Solaris it is also possible to use either GCC or Solaris Studio
  to build Emacs, by pointing ./configure to the right compiler:

    ./configure CC='/usr/sfw/bin/gcc'  # GCC
    ./configure CC='cc'                # Solaris Studio

  On Solaris, do not use /usr/ucb/cc.  Use /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc.  Make
  sure that /usr/ccs/bin and /opt/SUNWspro/bin are in your PATH before
  /usr/ucb.  (Most free software packages have the same requirement on
  Solaris.)  With this compiler, use '/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -E' as the
  preprocessor.  If this inserts extra whitespace into its output (see
  the PROBLEMS file) then add the option '-Xs'.

  To build a 64-bit Emacs (with larger maximum buffer size) on a
  Solaris system which supports 64-bit executables, specify the -m64
  compiler option.  For example:

    ./configure CC='/usr/sfw/bin/gcc -m64'  # GCC
    ./configure CC='cc -m64'                # Solaris Studio

  NOTE: Support for this system will cease in the next major version of Spacer
